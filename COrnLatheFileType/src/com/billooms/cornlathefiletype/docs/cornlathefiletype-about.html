        <h2>About Menu Actions</h2>
        <h3>File</h3>
        <p>
        	Many of the menu items are standard on most programs. 
        	The ones that I have added are:
        </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Open File</b> -- Open a previously saved xml file
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Save File</b> -- Save the file after edits have been made.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Save File As...</b> -- Save a copy of the data to a new file, leaving the old file unchanged.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Revert to Saved</b> -- Discard any edits you've made and re-load the previously saved file. 
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Save Outline</b> -- Saves the coordinates of the outline (i.e. the surface being cut) to 
				a tab-delimited text file. 
				Point spacing is based on the curve resolution. 
				This can be read into most spread-sheet programs. 
				There are columns for X and Z coordinates as well as the diameter and circumference at each point. 
				This allows the user to utilize a spreadsheet for other calculations relative to the surface of the object.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Page Setup...</b> -- Set page orientation for printing
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Print...</b> -- Prints the currently active window. 
				It's best to first click in the window you want to print to make sure that window is currently the 
				active window. 
			</li>
		</ul>
        <h3>Outline</h3>
		<ul>
				<li>
					<b>2Pts: Vertical</b> -- If you only have 2 points, this will make them perfectly vertical.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>2Pts: Horizontal</b> -- If you only have 2 points, this will make them perfectly horizontal.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Offset Top to Zero</b> -- Sets the top part of the cutter's path to zero.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Offset Bottom to Zero</b> -- Sets the bottom part of the cutter's path to zero.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Invert</b> -- Inverts the shape (i.e. turns it upside-down).
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Clear All</b> -- Clears the outline (for a fresh start).
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Zoom to Fit</b> -- Fit the outline in the window.
				</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>View3D</h3>
		<ul>
       	 	<li>
       	 		<b>Set Bowl Color...</b> -- Change the color of the bowl. 
       	 		This setting is saved when you exit the program and restored the next time.
        	</li>
        	<li>
        		<b>Set Background Color...</b> -- Change the color of the background. 
        		This setting is saved when you exit the program and restored the next time.
        	</li>
        	<li>
        		<b>Show Grid</b> --Enable/disable the grid. 
        		This setting is saved when you exit the program and restored the next time.
        	</li>
        	<li>
        		<b>Save 3D View...</b> -- Save the current view in the window as a jpeg file. 
        	</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Other Menu Items</h3>
        <p>
        	Most of the other Menu items are similar to other programs you have used. 
        	If in doubt, try it out and see what happens. 
        </p>

Tip: to create a link which will open in an external web browser, try:
<object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
    <param name="content" value="http://www.netbeans.org/">
    <param name="text" value="<html><u>http://www.netbeans.org/</u></html>">
    <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
    <param name="textColor" value="blue">
</object>
To create a link to a help set from another module, you need to know the code name base and path, e.g.:
<a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/configure/configure_options.html">Using the Options Window</a>
(This link will behave sanely if that module is disabled or missing.)
