# BowlShape2
The purpose is to help visualize a bowl or hollow form in 3D prior to turning.  
You draw an outline by moving several points (in the black window). 
A smooth line is curve-fit to the points. 
A 3-dimensional bowl shape is created from the outline, and can be rotated with the mouse to view it from all angles. 
The outline can be printed on a grid pattern and used as a template to turn the shape.
