        <h2>About OutlineEditor</h2>
        <p>
            The Outline Editor window is the main editing window to change the outline of the work. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	Just below the editing window at the far left, you see the location of the cursor at any time. 
        	On the far right edge is the total length of the outside of the curve.
        </p>
        <p>
        	You can change the thickness of your bowl by setting a new value for the "Thickness" field. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	The "Resolution" field is the over-all accuracy of the outline (and the 3D shape). 
        	A good number for this is around 0.020".
        </p>
        <h3>Maneuvering</h3>
        <p>
        	To zoom in/out, use the scroll wheel on your mouse. 
        	To pan, do a right click and move the mouse. 
        	You can also use the "Zoom to Fit" menu to nicely fill the window.
        </p>
        <h3 align="left">Editing outline points</h3>
        <p>
        	There are several different curves that you might see in the window:
        </p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The inside surface is a purple/magenta color.
				</li>
				<li>
					The outside surface is an orange/tan color.
				</li>
			</ul>
		<p>
			To enter a point, simply double-click where you want the new point to go. 
			To move a point, click on it and drag it somewhere else. 
			To remove a point, drag it outside the window and it will go away.
		</p>
		<p>
			Points should be entered starting at the bottom.
			As you enter additional points, they are in sorted order from bottom to top.
			If you want a point that is out of this order (as when you have a rim of a bowl that
			recurves downward), first enter the point up higher (to get it in proper sequence)
			then drag it down to where you want it.
		</p>
		<p>
			To get tighter curves, put points closer together.
			For example, one can approximate a corner by using a very tight curve
			with several points close together.
		</p>
        <h3 align="left">Menu for the "Outline"</h3>
        <p>
        	The menu bar has several items that only relate to the Outline Editor:
        </p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>2Pts: Vertical</b> -- If you only have 2 points, this will make them perfectly vertical.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>2Pts: Horizontal</b> -- If you only have 2 points, this will make them perfectly horizontal.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Offset Top to Zero</b> -- Sets the top part of the cutter's path to zero.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Offset Bottom to Zero</b> -- Sets the bottom part of the cutter's path to zero.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Invert</b> -- Inverts the shape (i.e. turns it upside-down).
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Clear All</b> -- Clears the outline (for a fresh start).
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Zoom to Fit</b> -- Fit the outline in the window.
				</li>
			</ul>
