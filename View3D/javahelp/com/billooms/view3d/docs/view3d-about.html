        <h2>About View3D</h2>
        <p>
            The 3D View window is for viewing the 3D bowl, 
            either as a plain (undecorated) shape or as a detailed (rendered) cut surface.
        </p>
        <h3 align="left">Rotate View or Bowl</h3>
        <p>
        	When rotating the View, the bowl stays in a fixed position on the grid.
        	Using the mouse, you can move around the view (i.e. like walking around the 
        	bowl that is setting on a table). 
        	This mode works best for vases that are decorated on the outside.
        </p>
        <p>
        	When rotating the Bowl, the grid remains fixed.
        	Using the mouse, you can move the bowl (i.e. like holding the bowl in your hand).
        	This mode works best for decorating the top of a shape or the inside of a shallow bowl.
        	Note that for a flat surface, you need to move the piece to get a good reflection 
        	from one of the light sources.
        </p>
        <h3 align="left">Using the mouse</h3>
        <p>
			Click with the mouse and move it around while holding the button down. 
			This lets you rotate the view around. 
			You can move the view left/right/up/down by using the right button (Mac use Apple-click). 
			You can zoom in closer (or further away) by using your mouse scroll-wheel (Mac use option-click and move the mouse up or down).
        </p>
        <p>
			While rotating the view, you’ll notice that the grid moves as well, and the light source remains above the bowl. 
			Another option is to rotate the bowl with respect to the grid and light source -- 
			click the pop-up menu in the lower right corner of the screen and select “Bowl” and try moving the bowl around. 
			This is good to see the underside features ofthe bowl. 
			In this mode, right-click moves the bowl left/right/up/down (Mac apple-click), 
			and alt-click (Mac option-click) moves the bowl closer or further away.
        </p>
        <p>
			The “Restore View” button always brings you back to the starting default viewpoint. 
        </p>
        <h3 align="left">Detailed Rendering</h3>
        <p>
        	When you select the "Render Detail" checkbox in the lower left-hand corner, 
        	the surface is rendered with the details of each cut. 
        	This is much slower than just showing a simple outline, so uncheck the box when you need fast response time.
        	Smaller resolutions will significantly slow the rendering time. 
        	If you have a resolution of less than 0.005", you will be asked if you really want to proceed.
        </p>
        <h3 align="left">View3D Menu actions</h3>
        <p>
        	"Set Bowl Color..." is used to change the color of the bowl. 
        	This setting is saved when you exit the program and restored the next time.
        </p>
        <p>
        	"Set Background Color..." is used to change the color of the background. 
        	This setting is saved when you exit the program and restored the next time.
        </p>
        <p>
        	"Show Grid" allows you to enable/disable the grid. 
        	This setting is saved when you exit the program and restored the next time.
        </p>
        <p>
        	"Save 3D View..." allows you to save the current view in the window as a jpeg file.

To create a link to a help set from another module, you need to know the code name base and path, e.g.:
<a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/configure/configure_options.html">Using the Options Window</a>
(This link will behave sanely if that module is disabled or missing.)
